    <h2>Randomness</h2>
    <p>
        One interesting aspect of programming is having access to libraries and functions that deal with statistics, probability, and randomness.
    </p>
    <p>
        What I've found for myself when using these libraries is that my innate "feeling" about probability and randomness is way off. In particular, if I generate a succession of random elements, I find that
        <em>extreme events happen more frequently than my "gut" tells me
                they should.</em
            >
        </p>
        <p>I've developed a quick-and-dirty little program to show this.</p>
        <p>
            Clicking the button below will return a random number from a normal
            distribution having a mean (average) value of 50 and a standard
            deviation of 20. For those who never took a statistics class (or who
            have forgotten everything if they did), a
            <a
                href="https://www.statsandr.com/blog/do-my-data-follow-a-normal-distribution-a-note-on-the-most-widely-used-distribution-and-how-to-test-for-normality-in-r/"
                >normal distribution</a
            >
            is quite common in the world: It's the "bell-shaped curve"
            distribution we're used to seeing. In a normal distribution, the
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation"
                >standard deviation</a
            >
            value lets us know how "spread out" the distribution is. It also
            lets us calculate what percentage of values fall within certain
            ranges.
        </p>
        <p>
            As noted, the distribution I've created has a mean of 50 and a
            standard deviation of 20. The chart below shows the relationship
            between standard deviation and percentiles. 68% of the values in a
            normal distribution fall within 1 standard deviation of the mean,
            and 95% fall within two standard deviations. Thus when you click the
            button, 68% of the time the random number you get will fall between
            30 and 70 (the mean of 50 plus and minus the standard deviation of
            20), and 95% will fall between 10 and 90 (the mean of 50 plus or
            minus 40 [two times the standard deviation of 20]).
        </p>

        <p></p>
        <p>
            I encourage you to take a few minutes and click the Random Number
            button and watch the results go by. I just did it as a part of
            checking if this page was functioning correctly. Within 10 clicks I
            received back a value of -16. This number is more than three
            standard deviations from the mean. Numbers outside of three standard
            deviations (that is, numbers less than -10 or more than 110) should
            come up only 3 times out of 1000. Yet I got one within 10 clicks.
            That's randomness, and it's scary, because as much as we'd like to
            comfort ourselves with the knowledge that 95% of values are within 2
            standard deviations, thus making us "safe" from rare events, that's
            an
            <em>aggregate</em> truth, not an individual one. As individuals, we don't get to aggregate; we have to push the button and see what happens, one result at a time.
    </p>
    <p>
        How long did it take for you see a number of more than 90 or less than 10 (happens 5% of the time), or more than 110 or less than -10 (happens only about 3 times out of 1000)?
