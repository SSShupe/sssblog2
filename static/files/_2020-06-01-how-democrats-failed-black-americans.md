<p>Following the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/minneapolis-police-george-floyd.html">shootings of George Floyd</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/06/13/atlanta-shooting-police-officer-kills-black-man-wendys-drive-thru/3183209001/" target="_blank">Rayshard Brooks</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jacob-blake-kenosha-shooting-wisconsin-police-black-man-protesters-gather/" target="_blank">Jacob Blake</a> and other Black Americans by white police officers, public protests and the "Black Lives Matter" movement have brought to the front of our national consciousness America's failure to address the impacts on Black Americans of 400-plus years of slavery, Jim Crow, and <em>de jure</em> and <em>de facto</em> segregation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I came of age shortly after the civil rights movement of the 1960s. From a nation then taking steps to recognize its history of degradation of Black Americans and to take steps to remedy the deep, dark impacts of that history, how did we get to where we are now: A nation where the President encourages white supremacists, issues anti-Black "dog whistle" tweets to his base, and supports flying the flag of the Confederacy (an entity dedicated to keeping Blacks enslaved)?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To many on the left, the answer is simple: White racism and antipathy toward Blacks never went away, and after 50 years of being stoked by the Right, culminating in Trump, it has become mainstream again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But this explanation is too simple and incomplete. For many years, the Democratic Party was in control of the White House and the Congress, yet conditions on the ground for most Black Americans did not advance much. This piece argues that the Democrats' long shift to an an "identity" politics that treats all non-white racial groups as equally deserving of government assistance (such as "affirmative action"), the Democrats helped create the racial divisions Trump has so vigorously exploited, and made more difficult the work of mitigating and remedying the unique historic wrongs inflicted on Black Americans.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The passage of the landmark Civil Rights Act in 1964 was an historic, long-overdue step to remedy four centuries of legally-sanctioned oppression of Black Americans. Its passage slowly resulted in a large party realignment, especially in the South. (It is reported that President Johnson said to an aide after signing the Act that the Democrats "had lost the South for a generation," although this is <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://capitalresearch.org/article/we-have-lost-the-south-for-a-generation-what-lyndon-johnson-said-or-would-have-said-if-only-he-had-said-it/" target="_blank">disputed</a>.) Voters who were the heart of Democratic coalition from 1935 to 1965 -- white unionized middle-class industrial-workers -- began to join the Republican Party, viewing the Democrats as the party of desegregation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rather than trying to recover any of this historic base (through, for example, continuing to focus on the economic interests of all lower- and middle-class voters, including whites), the Democrats sought to broaden their party by appealing to other constituencies. A central part of the Democrat's strategy was (and is) to appeal to all non-white racial and ethnic groups, creating a coalition of "People of Color." The Democrats' rationale is that all non-white racial groups are subject to discrimination, and that by joining together the fight to eliminate this discrimination is easier to win.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the Democratic "People of Color" strategy was (and is) both a strategic and moral mistake.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was a moral mistake because the history of Black people in the United States is not remotely comparable to that of any other racial group (except Native Americans, another special case deserving of special treatment). For over two hundred and fifty years, the British government, the United States government, and the governments of the various U.S. states allowed Blacks to be captured in Africa, subjugated, shipped to America under appalling conditions, and sold into slavery. Blacks were considered to be property, less-than-human. They were forced into hard physical labor, beaten, abused, mistreated, and degraded. Black women were subject to rape and abuse by their masters. This wasn't just a case of a racial or ethnic group being subjected to discrimination by the majority race. Rather, this was institutionalized: <em>The government of the United States and its constituent states explicitly supported the evil of slavery.</em> Slavery -- the abduction of human beings and their appropriation as property -- was <em>allowed and protected under our Country's laws.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While the United States abolished slavery after the Civil War, efforts during Reconstruction to incorporate Blacks into the American polity were laughably inadequate and temporary. The laws of our country -- especially those in the Southern states -- continued to treat Blacks as inferior to whites, with many fewer rights than full citizens. Blacks were denied the full ability to vote, prohibited from taking certain jobs, not allowed in restaurants or white swimming pools, not even allowed to drink from white water fountains. Blacks had no fair access to the legal system, and were often lynched by whites for crimes they did not commit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These <a href="https://www.ferris.edu/jimcrow/what.htm#:~:text=Jim%20Crow%20was%20the%20name,was%20a%20way%20of%20life.">"Jim Crow"</a> laws, along with its accompanying social caste system, continued in place for a full century after the abolition of slavery. Legalized discrimination against Black Americans did not end until the adoption of the Civil Rights Act in 1964.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Black Americans suffered four hundred years of inhuman, abusive, punitive treatment, were deprived of liberty and treated as sub-human. The United States government not only permitted these horrors, <em>it legally sanctioned them.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By lumping Black Americans into a "People of Color" bucket in order to expand their electoral base, the Democratic Party ignores the fact that the moral debt America owes to Blacks is different in kind and magnitude than that owed to other racial and ethnic groups. For example, it treats the situation of a El Salvadoran who <em>voluntarily chooses</em> for economic reasons to enter the U.S. without following our immigration laws -- and who has <em>never</em> been subjected to <em>legally, state-sanctioned</em> discrimination due to his or her race -- the same as the situation of the descendant of an African captured and involuntarily brought to America, where for 400 years <em>our nation's laws</em> encouraged the abuse and exploitation of his race as slaves, and denied his or her race the rights and opportunities given to other citizens.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There is no comparison between these two situations. Economic immigrants to a new country, frequently poorer and less-educated, almost always face discrimination in their new country, due to their lack of language skills, their different cultural backgrounds, and the perception that they take jobs away from native workers. Such discrimination is not necessarily race-based, as the experience of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.history.com/news/when-america-despised-the-irish-the-19th-centurys-refugee-crisis" target="_blank">Irish</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.pri.org/stories/2015-11-26/brief-history-america-s-hostility-previous-generation-mediterranean-migrants" target="_blank">Italian</a> immigrants to the U.S. in the 1800s will attest. It's an unfair but completely foreseeable, burden that immigrants bear. Such discrimination is undesirable and offensive, but compared to slavery, it pales. (It is also now <em>illegal</em>,unlike the situation in the 1800s.)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>America's 400-year history of Black oppression and domination has also ingrained in the non-Black population conscious or unconscious racist views towards Black Americans that simply aren't as strong as those faced by other racial groups. Put bluntly, it's unlikely that a white American in Grand Rapids would move to the other side of the a dark street upon seeing two Filipino men walking toward them. But two Black men would be another story entirely. The discrimination faced by Black Americans is significantly more ingrained and hostile than that faced by any other racial group. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Treating Black Americans as just another "People of Color" ignores both that the harm inflicted on Blacks was legally-sanctioned by our country, and that the nature and length of that harm -- the abduction, dehumanization, and physical violence of slavery and Jim Crow over almost 400 years -- brought suffering and humiliation to Blacks unlike that experienced by any other racial group. Making Black Americans just another "People of Color" ignores and minimizes the unique debt our country owes to its Black citizens because of our government's involvement in the immoral institution of slavery.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition, the Democratic Party's adoption of an "identity" politics that includes every ethnic and racial group <em>other than European whites</em> worsened racial divisions. In particular, the policy of "Affirmative Action", which may have had some political and moral justification if applied to Black Americans, was seen by many white Americans as itself racist, a surrender of the principle that Americans should not be discriminated against on account of race, and a giveaway of political spoils by Democrats to everyone other than European whites. This gave rise to an resentment on the part of white Americans against minority groups -- including Black Americans -- that didn't necessarily spring from racist antipathy, but was, rather, completely rational: I and my children are being discriminated against by the government because of the color of our skin.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The abdication of the "no discrimination on account of race" principle by Democrats through "Affirmative Action" deprived the Left of the moral high ground on issues of race. But it particularly hurt Black Americans. Rather than trying to create a situation in which white Americans might be convinced to support remedial and mitigative actions by the government to improve the situation of Black Americans due to the unique historical harms they suffered at governments' hands, the Democrats widened the us-versus-them schism between white Americans and all other racial groups, including Blacks. Democrats appeared to abandon the very idea of "Americans" -- one people united, <em>E Pluribus Unum</em>. There weren't Americans anymore, there were only African-Americans, Asian-Americans, Mexican-Americans, Pacific Islanders, Vietnamese-Americans, Arab-Americans, and so forth on one side, and white European-Americans on the other.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This was bound to further alienate many white European-Americans from the Democratic Party and increase the appeal of right-wing demagogues such as Trump. If the principle that individuals should be judged <a href="https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/martin_luther_king_jr_115056">not by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character</a> was being abandoned, if each ethnic and racial group was entitled to press for its own specific advantages and its own political spoils, well, then what about European whites? Government-sponsored discrimination against residents by color and ethnicity was, not surprisingly, racially divisive, and encouraged many white European-Americans to begin to consciously defend the interests of their own racial/ethnic group.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Democratic Party failed Black Americans in another way over the past 40 years: By focusing on bringing all "People of Color" into its electoral coalition, the party implicitly downplayed the unique circumstances of Black Americans, making them no more deserving of remedial measures than any other minority group. Worse, as the Democratic Party's "establishment", its intellectual and funding core, moved into the 21st century, it became more and more white, managerial, upper-middle class, and affluent. Remedying the condition of Black Americans was simply not one of this core's primary concerns. There is only so much time, energy, and "bandwidth" available to a political party, so it makes choices about which issues to highlight. Remedying the wrongs done to Black Americans, providing them with real opportunity to participate in American society, were no more important (and I'd claim, were <em>less </em>important) to the white, affluent Democratic "core" than issues such as the environment and advancing the role of women and gays in society. For example, many solid "core" Democrats saw nothing wrong with moving to "safer" urban areas with better schools (thus increasing segregation), and were more concerned with saving the Amazonian rainforest than helping Black Americans fully integrate into American society.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the same time, the importance of unions to the Democratic Party was declining, meaning that the party cared less and less about the economic concerns of the working class, no matter what their race. "Core" Democrats spent huge efforts in their personal lives making sure that <em>their</em> children didn't become working class. Moreover, race-based policies such as affirmative action corroded the solidarity necessary to allow the working class to effectively negotiate fair wages (and job retention) with corporate management. Under the Democrats and Affirmative Action, the defining motto isn't "Workers of the World, Unite!", but rather "All non-whites get a boost."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This plus the Democratic Party's disdain for the cultural conservatism of the white working class (as evidenced by Barack Obama's <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/apr/14/barackobama.uselections2008">"they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who aren't like them</a> remarks or Hillary Clinton's infamous <a href="https://time.com/4486502/hillary-clinton-basket-of-deplorables-transcript/">"basket of deplorables … the racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic"</a> remarks) fertilized the ground upon which Trump's poisonous garden of hatred, demagoguery, contempt of science, explicit racism, ignorance, and alternative facts could sprout and grow. Trump is a vile, unstable, racist and narcissist who has exacerbated divisions in our country, but he did not create those divisions alone.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If the Democratic Party is serious about improving the condition of Black Americans, it needs to recognize that the history of Black Americans in this country, and the problems they face as a result of that history, are not the same as other racial groups. While other "People of Color" may be subject to discrimination, the nature and magnitude of discrimination against Black Americans, and the social dysfunctions created by 400 years of slavery and governmentally-enforced oppression, which continue to be transmitted generation-to-generation, are orders of magnitude greater than those experienced by any other race.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I recognize that "People of Color" other than Native Americans and Black Americans have been subject to legally-sanctioned discrimination in the past, as were other groups. Women were not allowed to vote everywhere until 1920, and were subject to laws before that time that restricted them from exercising the same legal rights as men. Mexican Americans in California and the Southwest were deported after the U.S. acquired those territories. Japanese-Americans were forced into internment camps in WW2. Homosexuality was against the law <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodomy_laws_in_the_United_States">in every U.S. state until 1962</a>. I recognize too that prejudice against such groups continues to exist, in varying degrees. I am not advocating that discrimination against these groups is insignificant, or should be ignored. Such discrimination is now illegal in our country, and must stay that way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But no group has suffered as horribly, for as long, as Black Americans. Blacks are not just another "People of Color." The violence and oppression toward them, and the longstanding active resistance to allowing them to become part of the greater American society, is unique. No other racial group spent 300-plus years as slaves. While other racial and discrete groups have made strides towards becoming integrated into American society, the debilitating effects of slavery and Jim Crow continue to hold many Blacks back from full participation in our economy, politics, and society.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If the Democratic Party is serious about finally helping Black Americans become equal participants in the life of our country, it must prioritize the task of improving the conditions of Black Americans. It must stop advocating for legal preferences for every ethnic and racial group other than White Europeans, and work to convince whites and other non-Black racial and ethnic groups of the moral basis -- of the <em>rightness</em> -- of providing additional government aid and assistance to Black Americans, to mitigate and remedy the wrongs our country has done to them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This will require great effort, as it must be done from the "bottom up," and it will mean spending less energy and time on other priorities. Many in the Democratic coalition will object. Many will say that White Americans will never support a program to remediate the damage inflicted on the Black community by slavery and Jim Crow. But I remain optimistic. The "Black Lives Matter" movement has caused many White Americans to reflect deeply on the condition of Black Americans in our country. Racism continues to exist, but so does a strong desire to now put right what our nation did so wrong for centuries.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We have a moral duty to mitigate and remedy the vast and terrible historic wrongs we have inflicted on Black Americans. Let's get this enterprise started.</p>
