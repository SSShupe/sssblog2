<p>What is a “thought experiment”?</p>



<p>As the name suggests, it’s an “experiment” (usually conceived by scientists) that involves a hypothetical situation, conducted in one’s imagination rather than in the actual physical world.</p>



<p>Although that sounds dicey, there have been many thought experiments that have led to advances in scientific understanding. Albert Einstein made use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein%27s_thought_experiments">many thought experiments</a> in developing his theories of relativity. Perhaps the most famous thought experiment is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger%27s_cat">“Schrödinger's Cat”</a>, conceived by physicist Edwin Schrödinger to examine the nature of the relationship between the realm of quantum physics and “ordinary” reality. (Scientifically-curious readers may be interested in a <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/this-twist-on-schroedingers-cat-paradox-has-major-implications-for-quantum-theory/">recent experiment</a> exploring this further.)</p>



<p>My thought experiment is simpler. It doesn’t require understanding of quantum physics or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function_collapse">collapse of the quantum wavefunction</a>. It requires only self-honesty and a moderate level of knowledge about our current politics.</p>



<p><em>Imagine that we had a way to eliminate all racism, and all the impacts of racism, current, historical, and future, against all minorities, including Black Americans. Assume we can do this at zero cost.</em></p>



<p><em>All minorities would have, on average, the same educational levels and economic/social opportunities as whites. All social pathologies suffered by Black Americans as a result of 400 years of slavery and Jim Crow would be gone. A great historical wrong would finally be righted. We would finally have true Black-White racial equality and justice.</em></p>



<p><strong><em>All it takes is a “yes” vote by one-half of the Republicans in Congress:</em></strong><em> 133 of the combined 214 House Republicans and 50 Senate Republicans.</em></p>



<p><em>Do 133 Congressional Republicans vote “yes”?</em></p>



<p>What do you think?</p>


<p class="has-text-align-center">***</p>



<p>Consider what the thought processes of the 264 Republicans might be.</p>



<p>Does it help our electoral base? Not at all. Our predominantly white base would suffer from the increased competition for jobs and opportunities for advancement. They’d be less well-off than before.</p>



<p>Does it help our own chances of being re-elected? Not at all. The Republican base’s response to any Republican voting to make minority and Black Americans truly equal economic and social competitors to White Americans would be this -- You sold us out! The next primary election, most all the yes-voting Republicans would lose.</p>



<p>Does it help our party long-term? Not at all. What place does today’s Republican party have in a country at racial peace? The party would have to fall back to its staid old anti-tax, anti-regulation, pro-security, William F. Buckley self of 50 years ago. No room for nuts in that party! Plus making a core constituency of the Democratic party more economically powerful is harmful by itself.</p>



<p>Does it help our country? Ha! Trick question. Do you think more than a handful of the 264 would even consider this as a factor?</p>



<p>My view -- Only a few of Congressional Republicans would vote “yes”. It’s simply not in their interests.</p>



<p>Which leads to just one conclusion.</p>



<p>Republicans have become the party of unreconstructed White America. Racial animosity, especially against Black Americans, is a driving force in today’s Republican party.</p>



<p>The thought experiment doesn’t lie.</p>
