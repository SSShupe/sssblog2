Laugh-my-ass-off quote from Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale today in [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/06/19/donald-trump-campaign-rally-tulsa-protesters-329439):

> Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale played down concerns of a confrontation [at Trump's upcoming Tulsa rally]. “I've been here since day one, and I found all Trump supporters to be really caring, loving people that care about this country,” he told Fox News.

As to protesters who might come to Tulsa, Parscale said:

> The protesters, he argued, “want that moment where CNN or some other fake news media can try to make it look like a Trump supporter is not a loving and caring person.”

Loving and caring Trump supporters? As a 5-minute Google search reveals, they're _everywhere_:

I could add 100 more pictures, but you get the point. I think Brad Parscale needs to get out a little more, or perhaps just look around him to see the font of all this Loving and Caring.
